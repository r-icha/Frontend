## 1. for loop 
The for loop repeats a block of code a specific number of times.

Syntax :- for(initialization; condition; increment/decrement){
// code 
}

## 2. while loop
The while loop executes as long as the condition is true.
It can be thought of as a repeating if statement.

syntax :- 
initialization
while(condition){
     // increment/decrement;
}


## 3. do-while loop
It executes the code block at least once before checking the condition.

Syntax:- 
initialization
do{
    increment/decrement
}while(condition)


## Choosing the RIght Loop
Use for loop when the number of iterations is known.
Use while loop when the condition depends on dynamic factors.
Use do-while loop to ensure the block executes at least once.
